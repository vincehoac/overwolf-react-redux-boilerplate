# Overwolf-React-Redux-Boilerplate
This repo gets you started with everything you need to roll a React + Redux app in Overwolf.

Based on the Overwolf PUBG Dev samples from https://github.com/overwolf/pubg-dev-challenge-samples

Note: this repo probably won't be updated much, and is mostly meant to illustrate to you how React & Redux work together with Overwolf, rather than necessarily being a proper boilerplate that you might build your project on top of.
